# The project consists of 2 parts:

1. node-server
2. react-client

# Note

- Inside of each folder I have mentioned the steps to run them in their own readme files.
- First you should start the node-server, then run the react-client.

# Features implemented

- Used Node js for backend and React js for frontend.
- Used LLM provided by Gemini API to get the required information, not used OpenAI API as it wasn't accepting my debit card for payments.
- Used Playwright to get the html of websites.

# How to run?

- Make sure you have Node installed on your computer.
- Clone the repository into your local computer.
- Follow the steps given in readme files of node-server & react-client.
- We will run node-server on port 9000 and react-client on port 3000.

# Features not implemented

- Project isn't deployed, I faced some issues while deployment with playwright chrome executable.
- Pagination is not handled, faced some issue with Playwright.
